## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)

Our project is a data visualizer that accepts numeric csv data in a textarea form and creates datatables to display the information. One datatable will display the original data; a second datatable will then display the mean, variance, and standard deviation of each row as well as of the entirety of the table.

Our original intention of this project was just to have some fun and try out some CGI coding and data handling in a simple way. :smiley:
Although if anyone wants to crunch some quick numbers, we hope our site can help.
